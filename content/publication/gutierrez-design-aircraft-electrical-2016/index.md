abstract: 'As part of the technology research engaged in the EU Clean Sky 1 project,
  we present in this paper an electrical structure network (ESN) designed to prevent
  the impact on an electronic equipment of unwanted voltage drops appearing when nonmetal
  composite materials are used for grounding. An iterative process has been followed
  to reach an optimal tradeoff solution meeting all the aircraft requirements: structural,
  safety, low weight, electrical, etc. Guidelines on the design of a low-impedance
  metal ESN, to minimize the inductive behavior of the power distribution network,
  are outlined in this paper. To this end, we employ the UGRFDTD simulation tool,
  combining finite-difference time domain to analyze the general EM problem, and a
  multiconductor transmission-line network to handle internal coupling between cables
  running along coinciding routes. The capability of this tool to create time-domain
  snapshots of surface currents is shown to provide a useful way to optimize the ESN,
  thanks to the insight gained on the physics of the problem.'
