 abstract = {In order to calculate the impedance of metal return network connected with composite skin, the volume based partial element equivalent circuit method is used to model the return network, and the impedance between the nodes of the return network at different frequencies is calculated. The influence of the contact resistance between the elements of the current return networks on the impedance is also considered. Moreover, the influence of some component parameters on impedance is analysed. The calculation results verify the applicability of the algorithm and the correctness of the calculation results and provide some references for the composite aircraft current return networks in the fault management and electrical protection system design.},
