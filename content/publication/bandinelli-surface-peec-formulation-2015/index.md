abstract: This paper describes the approach developed to model the current return
  networks installed aboard aircrafts having parts made in composite materials. The
  surface partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) method is adopted for its high-fidelity
  modeling capabilities, and its accuracy in the low-frequency region, which is of
  interest for the characterization of the return networks. State of the art of PEEC
  modeling is implemented in order to allow real-life aircrafts to be modeled. A special
  complex mock-up has been realized and measured. The numerical results are compared
  with measurements to assess their adequacy.
