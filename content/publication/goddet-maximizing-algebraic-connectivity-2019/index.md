abstract: This paper proposes an innovative method for optimizing the connectivity
  of meshed electrical pathways used to carry return current and provide grounding
  in more composite aircrafts. In normal operation, these networks should ensure a
  low voltage drop between power sources and electrical loads. The networks are modelled
  as graphs and spectral graph analysis is used to study their complexity. Thanks
  to the insight into graph’s spectrum, a multi-scale reading of meshed networks topology
  is proposed and an optimization problem is defined to decrease the DC resistance
  of the network while keeping constant its total weight. It is based on the maximization
  of the second eigenvalue of the graph’s Laplacian matrix. The optimization problem
  is applied to a mock-up of a real aircraft current return network. The paper is
  concluded by checking the DC voltage drops in steady state conditions.
