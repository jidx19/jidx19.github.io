abstract: Along with the main trends and future challenges of electrical networks
  embedded in more-electrical aircraft, this article also focuses on optimization
  efforts in the field of industrial electronics and energy conversion. Optimization
  can be achieved by the means of expertise or from classical analysis methods, especially
  those based on simulations. However, novel approaches based on optimization algorithms,
  so-called integrated design by optimization, are becoming increasingly mature and
  will become particularly powerful if subsequent efforts are made in terms of modeling
  for design. In the first part, the current context and new standards of the more-electrical
  aircraft are summarized. The second part deals with the new trends and challenges
  of more electrical aircraft, with an emphasis on reversible and hybrid high-voltage
  dc networks including new storage devices. However, this discussion will mainly
  focus on systems optimization. Methodological orientations toward integrated optimal
  design are discussed with representative examples, such as for an environmental
  conditioning system (ECS).
