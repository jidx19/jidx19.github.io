abstract: The emergence of new composite materials in the aeronautical domain requires
  a paradigm shift in the electrical system design, especially concerning the current
  return path. The composite fuselage cannot comply with the required functionalities,
  as the aluminium skin does, due to its heating and conductive natural limitations.
  The aim of this paper is to propose some solutions for the design and the optimisation
  of the current return path in this new aeronautical environment, using a complex
  modelling method (PEEC-AMLFMM) coupled with, firstly, a path finding algorithm followed
  by an optimization process, secondly, with a global routing tool followed by an
  optimisation process and, thirdly, with a multi-agent system approach. A comparison
  between these methods is made. The first results obtained using our methodologies
  are promising, providing some solutions for the current return path in a composite
  aircraft.
