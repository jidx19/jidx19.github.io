 abstract = {The emergence of new composite materials in the aeronautical domain requires a paradigm shift in the electrical system design, especially concerning the current return path. The composite fuselage cannot comply with the required functionalities, as the aluminium skin does, due to its heating and conductive natural limitations. The aim of this paper is to propose some solutions for the design and the optimisation of the current return path in this new aeronautical environment, using a complex modelling method (PEEC-AMLFMM) coupled with, firstly, a path finding algorithm followed by an optimization process, secondly, with a global routing tool followed by an optimisation process and, thirdly, with a multi-agent system approach. A comparison between these methods is made. The first results obtained using our methodologies are promising, providing some solutions for the current return path in a composite aircraft.},
