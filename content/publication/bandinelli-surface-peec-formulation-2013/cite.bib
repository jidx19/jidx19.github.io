 abstract = {This paper presents a systematic methodology based on the Partial Element Equivalent Circuit method to model aircrafts in order to characterize their current return network. The state-of-the-art of numerical modeling techniques for electrically large structures is used to allow accurate and fast simulations. The comparison of the numerical results with experimental data validates the procedure.},
