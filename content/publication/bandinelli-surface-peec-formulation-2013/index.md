abstract: This paper presents a systematic methodology based on the Partial Element
  Equivalent Circuit method to model aircrafts in order to characterize their current
  return network. The state-of-the-art of numerical modeling techniques for electrically
  large structures is used to allow accurate and fast simulations. The comparison
  of the numerical results with experimental data validates the procedure.
