abstract: The upward trend for the use of electrical power on state-of-the-art aircraft
  is resulting in significant change to the design of power system architectures and
  protection systems for these platforms. There is a pull from the aerospace industry
  to integrate the electrical power system with the aircraft's structural materials
  to form an embedded system, reducing the need for bulky cable harnesses. This directly
  impacts the fault response for ground faults and ultimately the development of appropriate
  protection systems. Such structural materials include composites such as carbon
  fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). This paper presents the experimental capture and
  analysis of the response of CFRP to electrical fault current, which indicates the
  need for two distinct sets of electrical ground fault detection criteria for low
  and high resistance faults and identifies the threshold resistance for this distinction.
  By extrapolating these results to develop models of CFRP for use in transient simulation
  studies, the key electrical fault detection thresholds for speed, selectivity, and
  sensitivity for a dc system rail to ground fault through CFRP are identified. This
  provides the first set of key factors for electrical fault detection through CFRP,
  providing a platform for the design of fully integrated structural and electrical
  power systems, with appropriate electrical protection systems.
