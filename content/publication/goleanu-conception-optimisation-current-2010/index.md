abstract: 'Future aircrafts start seeing the replacement of their existing metal skin
  by composite materials. The emergence of these new materials in this environment
  requires a paradigm shift in the electrical network design, especially regarding
  the current return path. The composite fuselage cannot comply anymore with all the
  functionalities of the current aluminum skin because of the imposed maximum admissible
  current density in the composite structure. The aim of this paper is to propose
  a solution for the design and the optimization of a current return path in this
  new aeronautical environment, using several coupled methods: PEEC modeling method,
  an automatic cabling design tool and optimization algorithms.'
