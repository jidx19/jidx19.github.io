abstract: The extensive introduction of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) in
  conjunction with an increase of electrical systems in aircraft has led to new electromagnetic
  issues. This situation has reinforced the need for numerical simulation early in
  the design phase. In this context, we have proposed [1] a numerical methodology
  to deal with 3D CFRP avionic structures in time domain simulations at system level.
  This paper presents the last results on this subject and particularly the modeling
  of A350 fuselage in SABER computation containing the aircraft power distribution.
