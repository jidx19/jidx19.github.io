 abstract = {The extensive introduction of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) in conjunction with an increase of electrical systems in aircraft has led to new electromagnetic issues. This situation has reinforced the need for numerical simulation early in the design phase. In this context, we have proposed [1] a numerical methodology to deal with 3D CFRP avionic structures in time domain simulations at system level. This paper presents the last results on this subject and particularly the modeling of A350 fuselage in SABER computation containing the aircraft power distribution.},
