	abstract = {This paper proposes an innovative method for optimizing the connectivity of meshed electrical pathways used to carry return current and provide grounding in more composite aircrafts. In normal operation, these networks should ensure a low voltage drop between power sources and electrical loads. The networks are modelled as graphs and spectral graph analysis is used to study their complexity. Thanks to the insight into graph’s spectrum, a multi-scale reading of meshed networks topology is proposed and an optimization problem is defined to decrease the DC resistance of the network while keeping constant its total weight. It is based on the maximization of the second eigenvalue of the graph’s Laplacian matrix. The optimization problem is applied to a mock-up of a real aircraft current return network. The paper is concluded by checking the DC voltage drops in steady state conditions.},

An iterative process has been followed to reach an optimal tradeoff solution meeting all the aircraft requirements: structural, safety, low weight, electrical, etc. Guidelines on the design of a low-impedance metal ESN, to minimize the inductive behavior of the power distribution network, are outlined in this paper. To this end, we employ the UGRFDTD simulation tool, combining finite-difference time domain to analyze the general EM problem, and a multiconductor transmission-line network to handle internal coupling between cables running along coinciding routes. The capability of this tool to create time-domain snapshots of surface currents is shown to provide a useful way to optimize the ESN, thanks to the insight gained on the physics of the problem.},

	abstract = {The upward trend for the use of electrical power on state-of-the-art aircraft is resulting in significant change to the design of power system architectures and protection systems for these platforms. There is a pull from the aerospace industry to integrate the electrical power system with the aircraft's structural materials to form an embedded system, reducing the need for bulky cable harnesses. This directly impacts the fault response for ground faults and ultimately the development of appropriate protection systems. Such structural materials include composites such as carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). This paper presents the experimental capture and analysis of the response of CFRP to electrical fault current, which indicates the need for two distinct sets of electrical ground fault detection criteria for low and high resistance faults and identifies the threshold resistance for this distinction. By extrapolating these results to develop models of CFRP for use in transient simulation studies, the key electrical fault detection thresholds for speed, selectivity, and sensitivity for a dc system rail to ground fault through CFRP are identified. This provides the first set of key factors for electrical fault detection through CFRP, providing a platform for the design of fully integrated structural and electrical power systems, with appropriate electrical protection systems.},

Optimization can be achieved by the means of expertise or from classical analysis methods, especially those based on simulations. However, novel approaches based on optimization algorithms, so-called integrated design by optimization, are becoming increasingly mature and will become particularly powerful if subsequent efforts are made in terms of modeling for design. In the first part, the current context and new standards of the more-electrical aircraft are summarized. The second part deals with the new trends and challenges of more electrical aircraft, with an emphasis on reversible and hybrid high-voltage dc networks including new storage devices. However, this discussion will mainly focus on systems optimization. Methodological orientations toward integrated optimal design are discussed with representative examples, such as for an environmental conditioning system (ECS).},
